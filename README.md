# Football Strategy Analysis

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview :

The Football Strategy Dashboard is designed to analyze game strategies by evaluating various actions taken during football plays. It provides insights into the average trusted judgments made by players, the frequency of different types of plays, and the average time left for decision-making.

**Key Features of the Dashboard :**

- Card Plot:
Displays the average of antecedent:confidence.
Shows the count of unit_state.
Illustrates the average of trusted_judgments.

- Slicer Visualizations:
Unit States: Allows filtering by the different states of the units (e.g., finalized).
Yardline & Points: Filters the data based on specific yardline and points options.

- Stacked Column Chart:
X-axis: Represents orig_antecedent.
Y-axis: Visualizes the average of trusted_judgments by orig_antecedent and average antecedent:confidence.

- Pie Chart:
Legend: Categorical distribution by antecedent.
Values: Shows the average of time left (in minutes) by antecedent.
